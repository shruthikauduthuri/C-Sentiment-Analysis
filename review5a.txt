"For $70/night a few blocks from Times Square....you can't beat it. Here is what I found recently (mid October, 2017).
Shunichi went out of his way (via text) to accommodate my late morning arrival (before he had a chance to clean from another guest who had not even left yet). I met him at his employment where he gave me keys and directions for setting my bags down in his living room.
From Penn Station to his place, a taxi would normally cost about $10 (including tip). From Penn to his employment (opposite direction) and then to his place was about $30 total. Easy to walk the distance(s) if you do not have heavy bags to carry (I did). I would say his neighborhood is quite safe.
Basic needs are in the room. If you expect super basic you will not be disappointed, if you expect “style,” then this is not a place for you. I would say that is it clean “enough,” but I did not take a shower.
Keys: the key to locks of both building entrance doors (2) are not well aligned. I struggled for a couple of minutes, almost called him (and I can’t really say what to do to get it to work). Key to apt. itself is fine.
Never having stayed in downtown NYC, I was interested to learn about noise. Sunichi’s place is about 6 houses in from a main drag (8th Street) and on the second floor. I was impressed with how little I heard from the outside (with the window open a couple of inches), only an occasional siren on 8th (main drag). I slept in until 8:30...sweet!
Would I stay there again? I would consider it, but I’d look around for another possibility, too."
