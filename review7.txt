The Midtown Castle is a beautiful place to stay in the center of the city. Truly a sanctuary with everything you need. Little touches of nature and beauty throughout. Waking up with the sun from the skylight was amazing.
This apartment is convenient and functional. The huge skylight makes it feel open and airy. And it is located smack dab in the middle of Manhattan. Highly recommended.
Great place. Would definitely recommend! Jennifer is really sweet and easy going.
Beautiful and stylish spot in a very unique building! Jennifer is a wonderful host and was kind enough to meet us for out late-night check-in. We loved the apartment!
Jennifer's space was such a lovely experience. PreCheckin and checkin was detailed and seamless, she made it easier on us and answered all questions so quickly. The space itself is such a unique, clear & zen energy- we loved it. Not to mention it was very clean & close to everything! Definitely be prepared for the 4flight workout (we appreciated that)! We enjoyed the space and location & would recommend this to anyone coming to explore the city!!
"Jennifer was super friendly and helpful. Great host with an amazing studio apartment right in the middle of NYC. Everything is walking distance! The Empire State Building, Times Square, and New York library were all around the corner or less than 15 minutes walk. Best location ever and great relaxing place to stay.
