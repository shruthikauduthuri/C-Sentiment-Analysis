FORMATTED REVIEW: 
An interesting local place with river views and good food in the moderate price range. It leans 
heavily toward sea food but there are menu items for the foul and bovine inclined. Reservations 
for diner are a must, particularly on Friday and Saturday or any day a popular show is appearing 
at the Count Basie Theatre. Two appetizers and two entrees with nonalcoholic drinks set us back 
$91 with tip. Fairly reasonable. We sat at a lovely set, uncomplicated, table with a beautiful 
view of the Navesink river and it's boat traffic. The service was polite, amiable and generally 
proficient about seeing to our needs. On this day I opened with the caprese salad which was very 
nicely done. The pesto was a tasty accent, not over powering. The wet mozzarella perfect and 
heirloom tomatoes glorious. They flavors coming together very nicely. My wife had an oyster 
dish that I'm having a senior moment trying to pull the name from memory, however it's sauce was 
delicious (I'm not a big oyster fan). I kept my entree simple: fish and chips. The fish was a nice 
thick piece of cod, not some cod replacement and fried to perfection. The fries were fries. :) My 
wife had the lobster roll, which she gave high marks. Overall a good place to dine before a show or 
after a late afternoon/ early evening walk about. It's not child adverse and a few dotted the 
tables while we were there but, at dinner at least, it runs toward an adult crowd. The parking can 
be difficult on popular show nights or Friday evening but the municipal lot is just across the 
street and you don't have to pay after 6pm. It's a thumbs up here.

Garon is undoubtedly the most welcoming and nice host ever. You feel at home right away, he is 
exciting and passionate, discussions are super interesting and he is extremely friendly. A 
stay at his place is a good mood cure. I highly recommend! It was so nice staying at Garon's! For 
the first glance it didn't look very fancy or something, but this place is gorgeous from inside 
out. It's pretty easy to get to subway G train or if you walk a little more you can get to A train 
which goes directly to JFK airport. Garon is a very kind person, very open-minded and friendly! 
We also have a lot in common in area of culture! I'll recommend this place to everyone who is 
open-minded and want to feel how people live there in NYC. Neighborhood looked safe. Despite it 
was one of the coldest weeks for last year in town, but heating worked well and the room was warm! 
"I had the most beautiful stay, Garon is a very special person and an absolute angel, made me feel 
totally at home in a highly peaceful and relaxed environment, I throughly recommend Bliss Art

The Midtown Castle is a beautiful place to stay in the center of the city. Truly a sanctuary with 
everything you need. Little touches of nature and beauty throughout. Waking up with the sun 
from the skylight was amazing. This apartment is convenient and functional. The huge skylight 
makes it feel open and airy. And it is located smack dab in the middle of Manhattan. Highly 
recommended. Great place. Would definitely recommend! Jennifer is really sweet and easy 
going. Beautiful and stylish spot in a very unique building! Jennifer is a wonderful host and 
was kind enough to meet us for out late-night check-in. We loved the apartment! Jennifer's 
space was such a lovely experience. PreCheckin and checkin was detailed and seamless, she made 
it easier on us and answered all questions so quickly. The space itself is such a unique, clear & 
zen energy- we loved it. Not to mention it was very clean & close to everything! Definitely be 
prepared for the 4flight workout (we appreciated that)! We enjoyed the space and location & 
would recommend this to anyone coming to explore the city!! "Jennifer was super friendly and 
helpful. Great host with an amazing studio apartment right in the middle of NYC. Everything is

UPDATED REVIEW (MORE POSITIVE):
The Midtown Castle is a beautiful place to stay in the center of the city. Truly a sanctuary with 
everything you need. Little touches of nature and beauty throughout. Waking up with the sun 
from the skylight was amazing. This apartment is convenient and functional. The huge skylight 
makes it glorious open and airy. And it is located smack dab in the middle of Manhattan. Highly 
recommended. Great place. Would definitely recommend! Jennifer is really sweet and easy 
going. Beautiful and stylish spot in a very unique building! Jennifer is a wonderful host and 
was kind enough to meet us for out late-night check-in. We loved the apartment! Jennifer's 
space was such a lovely experience. PreCheckin and checkin was detailed and seamless, she made 
it easier on us and answered all questions so quickly. The space itself is such a unique, clear & 
zen energy- we loved it. Not to mention it was very boyish & close to everything! Definitely be 
prepared for the 4flight workout (we appreciated that)! We enjoyed the space and location & 
would recommend this to anyone coming to explore the city!! "Jennifer was super friendly and 
helpful. Great host with an amazing studio apartment right in the middle of NYC. Everything is 
walking distance! The Empire State Building, Times Square, and New York library were all

FORMATTED REVIEW: 
Would say our greatest compliments to Jennifer, the host of Midtown Castle. We spent in this 
lovely apartment in the heart of Manhattan one month (April, 2012) and will remember this time 
as ours best. The apartment is pretty spacious and great located - the 5-th Ave right around the 
corner. There is everything you can need during your short or long stay. Jennifer is very 
friendly, vigorous and very responsible host. Thanks her and highly recomend this apartment 
for everyone who are looking for a quiet place right in the center of the boiling Midtown!" We had 
a wonderful stay at Jennifer's charming apartment! They were very organized and helpful; I 
would definitely recommend staying at the Midtown Castle!
