For my stay the apartment was also not ideal, there is no couch, only cushions on the floor and there is no real table and chairs. I had to work from home sometimes and could not really do it anywhere.
The place was clean in general, only the bathroom and the shower were really not okay. Especially the shower curtain was mildewed.
The kitchen was clean and well equipped.
Apartment has an AC, which is definitely a pro.
